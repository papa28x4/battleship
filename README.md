# battleship

This project is inspired by the Battleship project I did while go through the Head First JavaScript Programming by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson. So I extend the functionality of the game by improving the user experience. I give the player, audio/visual feedback and an alternative way to interact with the game. Rather than type in a cell number, the user can click or touch a cell to aim at that cell. In addition, I fixed a bug so that play cannot continue after the winning condition has been met.

A battleship occupies 3 adjacent cells. It takes 3 hits to sink a battleship. You'll need to sink 3 battleships to win. That's 9 hits in total.
