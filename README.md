# battleship

This project is inspired by the Battleship project I did while going through the Head First JavaScript Programming by Eric Freeman

& Elisabeth Robson. 


I extend the game's functionality by improving its user experience. I give the player, audio/visual feedback 

and an alternative way to interact with the game. Rather than type in a cell number, the user can click or touch a cell to aim at 

that cell. In addition, I fix a bug so that play cannot continue after the winning condition has been met.


A battleship occupies 3 adjacent cells. It takes 3 hits to sink a battleship. You'll need to sink 3 battleships to win. That's 9(3 

x3)hits in total.
